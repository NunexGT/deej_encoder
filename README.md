# deej_encoder
Branch of the Deej Library by Omriharel but for use with encoders.

With this, you can now control your PC Sound, program by program, in a really practical way!

<h1>Bill of Materials</h1>
Here´s what you need to buy for this project
<ul>
  <li>1 Arduino Nano or Uno (these are the recommended ones) 5V with ATmega 328</li>
  <li>(As much apps as you want to control, plus master) Rotary Encoders</li>
  <li>~30 Jumper cables (it´s better to have spare) Jumper Cables</li>
  <li>Welding Equipment (Machine and welds)</li>
 </ul>
<b>Optionals</b>
 <ul>
  <li>A BreadBoard (make sure that your breadboard has (+-) pins, if it doesn´t have is a PCB board, wich is useless in this case, unless to train welding)</li>
  <li>Led´s</li>
  <li>A case and/or material to make it</li>
 </ul>

*Note:<i>I can´t confirm if the vcc cconnected in this way will work properly because I used the first type of Rotary Encoders (Without VCC)</i>
